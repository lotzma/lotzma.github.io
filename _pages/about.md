I am a member of the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/">Mathematics Institute</a> of the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk">University of Warwick</a>, working broadly on foundations of computational mathematics. 

Prior to Warwick I was a Lecturer in <a href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing/"> Numerical Analysis</a> at the <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk">University of Manchester</a> and held research positions at the <a href="http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/ma/">City University of Hong Kong</a>, at the <a href="http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh</a>, supported by a <a href="http://www.leverhulme.ac.uk">Leverhulme Trust</a> and Seggie Brown Fellowship. 

I received my undergraduate degree from the <a href="http://www.math.ethz.ch">ETH</a> (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in Z&uuml;rich, and a PhD at the <a href="http://www.uni-paderborn.de">University of Paderborn</a>, with a thesis on <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540605829">Algebraic Complexity Theory</a>.
